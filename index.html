                <h2>The Idea of Wunderlist 2.0</h2>
                <p>The initial innovations of the first Wunderlist app were monumental to the definition of what an app could do to be helpful in a persons life. Wunderlist lifted the to do list to an art form of a fully functional self management assistant.
                    With our innovation came popularity and more coordination features. This success is what made Microsoft buy the rights to Wunderlist, shut it down, and a forced conversion to their platform called 'To Do.'</p>
                <p>Our application, Wunderlist 2.0 is based on a revival of the original Wunderlist with some additions that aid in the coordinations of teams for small organizations. It will have the simplicity you love with the ability to coordinate your
                    actions amongst your friends or work teams if needed. Get Organized, Capture Details, Enhance Communication, Track time and Make Progress. Keep things simple and still mananage the hardest project you have in your life, -- yourself!</p>
